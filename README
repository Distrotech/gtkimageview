This is the README file for the GtkImageView widget.

GtkImageView is a widget that provides a zoomable and panable view of
a GdkPixbuf. It is intended to be usable in most types of image
viewing applications.

Compilation
===========
The usual business:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/some/prefix
    $ make
    $ make install

You can also use the --enable-gtk-doc configure argument to enable
building of API documentation.

Alternatively, GtkImageView can be built with waf:

    $ ./waf configure
    $ ./waf build
    $ ./waf install

Because GtkImageView uses c99, you must use a version of gcc newer
than 2.96. The gnome-common module must also be installed.

Todo
====

* Maybe make rotations work correctly.
* Implement shifted selection rectangle moving and resizing.

Subject: [ANN] GtkImageView 1.6.4 - Image viewer widget for GTK+
)

I'm pleased to finally announce GtkImageView 1.6.4!

Description
-----------
GtkImageView is a simple image viewer widget for GTK+. Similar to the
image viewer panes in gThumb or Eye of Gnome. It makes writing image
viewing and editing applications easy. Among its features are:

* Mouse and keyboard zooming.
* Scrolling and dragging.
* Adjustable interpolation.
* Fullscreen mode.
* GIF animation support.
* Ability to make selections.
* Extensible using a tool system.

Bindings exists for Perl and Python.

Examples
--------
Here is the canonical example for using the widget::

    #include <gtkimageview/gtkimagescrollwin.h>
    #include <gtkimageview/gtkimageview.h>
    ...
    GtkWidget *view = gtk_image_view_new ();
    GtkWidget *scroll = gtk_image_scroll_win_new (GTK_IMAGE_VIEW (view));
    
    /* Where "box" is a GtkBox already part of your layout. */
    gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box), scroll, TRUE, TRUE, 0);
    
    GdkPixbuf *pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file ("someimage.png", NULL);
    gtk_image_view_set_pixbuf (GTK_IMAGE_VIEW (view), pixbuf, TRUE);

Future
------
* Gtk# bindings.
* Haskell bindings.
