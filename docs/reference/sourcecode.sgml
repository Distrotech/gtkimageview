    <para>
      This chapter contains important information for those that want
      to hack on the code.
    </para>
    <para>
      All source code is located in the <filename>src</filename>
      directory. Each C source code file has a matching header
      file. The header files are divided into two groups; those that
      are part of the <emphasis>public API</emphasis> and those that
      are not. All public API files are named using
      the <filename>gtk</filename> or <filename>gdk</filename>
      prefix. Each of them have a corresponding reference page devoted
      to them in this manual. Although both public and "private"
      header files are installed, the intention is that client code
      should only use declarations in the public header files.
    </para>
    <para>
      Both public and private headers are installed because
      GtkImageView does not use the <ulink url =
      "http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/028.htm">Pimpl idiom</ulink>. The Pimpl
      idiom is not currently used because it makes the source code
      much uglier. That may change in future releases (see <ulink url
      = "http://trac.bjourne.webfactional.com/ticket/9">ticket
      9</ulink>).
    </para>
    <para>
      There is no coding standards for this project because there
      hasn't been any need for one. However, it is my hope that the
      code is clear an concise enough. :) Each file has an <ulink url
      = "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</ulink> mode line
      definition at the top which enforces my preferred coding style:
    </para>
    <literallayout>
      <userinput>-*- Mode: C; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; c-basic-offset: 4; coding: utf-8 -*-</userinput>
    </literallayout>
    <para>
      There is probably some equivalent mode line setting for vim.
