          Fix for <ulink url =
          "http://trac.bjourne.webfactional.com/ticket/23">ticket11</ulink>. The
          tools mouse motion and button release event handlers should

          themselves.

          Fix for <ulink url =
          "http://trac.bjourne.webfactional.com/ticket/23">ticket29</ulink>. The
          static image is displayed instead of the first frame of an
          animation in case that animation only has one frame. This
          helps make progressive loading work better.

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <function>gtk_image_view_image_to_widget_rect()</function>
          was added to <classname>GtkImageView</classname>. It is a
          utility function useful determining where on the widget a
          certain part of the image is.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          The
          function <function>gtk_image_view_damage_pixels()</function>
          was added. It is supposed to be used instead
          of <function>gtk_image_view_set_pixbuf</function> to mark an
          area as damaged.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <function>gtk_iimage_tool_pixbuf_changed()</function> got a
          third argument which is a pointer either to the changed
          rectangle in the pixbuf or <constant>NULL</constant>. This
          was needed to accomodate for the new pixel damage system.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <classname>ImageViewDrawer</classname> was renamed
          to <classname>GdkPixbufDrawCache</classname> and placed in
          the file <filename>gdkpixbufdrawcache.c</filename>. It is
          now part of the public interface. See its documentation page
          for more information.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          A new
          function <function>gtk_image_view_library_version()</function>
          was added to find out the runtime version of GtkImageView.

      <title>Major changes in 1.5.0</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <function>gtk_image_nav_get_pixbuf()</function> was added
          to <classname>GtkImageNav</classname>. It returns the
          downsampled pixbuf the navigator is showing
          or <constant>NULL</constant>. The function is mostly useful
          for testing.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <classname>GtkImageNav</classname> aquired a flag variable
          that controls that the downsampled pixbuf is not created
          unless necessary. It makes
          the <classname>GtkImageScrollWin</classname> faster to
          instantiate, but may break ABI.
        </listitem>  
      </itemizedlist>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Major changes in 1.4.0</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          The
          function <function>gtk_image_view_get_draw_rect()</function>
          was added. It is a useful function used by both of the
          tools.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          The navigator button
          in <classname>GtkImageScrollWin</classname> now has a cute
          tooltip and the same prelight effect that <ulink url =
          "http://developer.gnome.org/arch/gnome/corecomponents/panel/">gnome-panel</ulink>
          has.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Redraw speed has been improved greatly. In particular,
          GtkImageToolSelector and redraws caused by moving other
          windows on top of the widget should now be much quicker.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Killed
          the <function>gtk_image_view_set_offset_invalidating()</function>
          function.
          Instead, <function>gtk_image_view_set_offset()</function>
          has a boolean flag which indicates whether to do an
          invalidating redraw or a fast scroll. This change breaks API
          and maybe also ABI.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          GtkFitMode was removed along
          with <function>gtk_image_view_set_fit_mode()</function>
          and <function>gtk_image_view_get_fit_mode()</function>.
          Since there were only two items in the enum (fit or not
          fit), it was much cleaner to just pass a gboolean. The
          accessor functions has also been renamed
          to <function>gtk_image_view_set_fitting()</function>
          and <function>gtk_image_view_get_fit_mode()</function> to
          reflect this new and simpler interface. This change also
          breaks API and perhaps even ABI.

      <title>Major changes in 1.3.0</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The <classname>GtkImageView</classname> widget has
            undergone major internal reconstruction work. I wanted to
            support making rectangular selections on the view
            area. Selections are useful for many reasons -- selecting,
            cutting, cropping etc. I want to support exactly the kind
            of selection tool that gThumb's image crop dialog has.
          </para>
          <para>
            To implement this feature GtkImageView has been made
            extensible via aggregation. It now uses an interface
            called <interfacename>GtkIImageTool</interfacename> which
            encapsulats certain behaviour. This means that it will be
            possible to extend GtkImageView with other tools too, such
            as drawing tools.
          </para>
          <para>
            The feature isn't completed yet, but I'm checking it in
            anyway to avoid having to check in a super-large changeset
            at an even later date. See <ulink url =
            "http://bjourne.blogspot.com/2007/05/tools-for-gtkimageview.html">this
            blog post</ulink> for even more details.
          </para>
          <para>
            There is currently two tools implemented,
            <classname>GtkImageToolDragger</classname> and
            <classname>GtkImageToolSelector</classname>. See their
            respective manual pages.
          </para>  
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          The
          function <function>gtk_image_view_set_offset_invalidating()</function>
          was added. The function has the same purpose as
          <function>gtk_image_view_set_offset()</function>, but queues
          the redraw by invalidating the whole widget instead of
          immediately repainting. The effect is that superfluous
          redraws can sometimes be avoided at the expense of more cpu
          usage.

      <title>Major changes in 1.2.0</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          The
          functions <function>gtk_image_view_get_check_colors()</function>
          and <function>gtk_image_view_set_transp()</function> was
          added. These additions enable users to define how
          GtkImageView should render transparent parts of images with
          an alpha
          channel. See <filename>./tests/interactive.c</filename> for
          an example.

      <title>Major changes in 1.1.0</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <function>gtk_image_view_set_pixbuf()</function> was
            changed to accept three parameters. The third parameter is
            a <type>gboolean</type> that defines whether to reset fit
            mode or not. It should almost always be TRUE.
          </para>
          <para>
            This change replaces the old (and
            undocumented) <function>gtk_image_view_set_pixbuf_no_repaint()</function>
            function.
