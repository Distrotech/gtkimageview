          The

          was added to <classname>GtkImageView</classname>. It
          simplifies converting from widget to image coordinates.

          Fix for <ulink url =
          "http://trac.bjourne.webfactional.com/ticket/23">ticket11</ulink>. The
          tools mouse motion and button release event handlers should

          Fix for <ulink url =

          static image is displayed instead of the first frame of an
          animation in case that animation only has one frame. This
          helps make progressive loading work better.

          Fix for <ulink url =

          small zoom factors are disallowed which should prevent the

        <listitem>
          <function>gtk_image_view_image_to_widget_rect()</function>
          was added to <classname>GtkImageView</classname>. It is a
          utility function useful determining where on the widget a
          certain part of the image is.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          The
          function <function>gtk_image_view_damage_pixels()</function>
          was added. It is supposed to be used instead
          of <function>gtk_image_view_set_pixbuf</function> to mark an
          area as damaged.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <function>gtk_iimage_tool_pixbuf_changed()</function> got a
          third argument which is a pointer either to the changed
          rectangle in the pixbuf or <constant>NULL</constant>. This
          was needed to accomodate for the new pixel damage system.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <classname>ImageViewDrawer</classname> was renamed
          to <classname>GdkPixbufDrawCache</classname> and placed in
          the file <filename>gdkpixbufdrawcache.c</filename>. It is
          now part of the public interface. See its documentation page
          for more information.

        <listitem>
          A new
          function <function>gtk_image_view_library_version()</function>
          was added to find out the runtime version of GtkImageView.

      <title>Major changes in 1.5.0</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <function>gtk_image_nav_get_pixbuf()</function> was added
          to <classname>GtkImageNav</classname>. It returns the
          downsampled pixbuf the navigator is showing
          or <constant>NULL</constant>. The function is mostly useful
          for testing.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <classname>GtkImageNav</classname> aquired a flag variable
          that controls that the downsampled pixbuf is not created
          unless necessary. It makes
          the <classname>GtkImageScrollWin</classname> faster to
          instantiate, but may break ABI.

      <title>Major changes in 1.4.0</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          The
          function <function>gtk_image_view_get_draw_rect()</function>
          was added. It is a useful function used by both of the
          tools.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          The navigator button
          in <classname>GtkImageScrollWin</classname> now has a cute
          tooltip and the same prelight effect that <ulink url =
          "http://developer.gnome.org/arch/gnome/corecomponents/panel/">gnome-panel</ulink>
          has.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Redraw speed has been improved greatly. In particular,
          GtkImageToolSelector and redraws caused by moving other
          windows on top of the widget should now be much quicker.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Killed
          the <function>gtk_image_view_set_offset_invalidating()</function>
          function.
          Instead, <function>gtk_image_view_set_offset()</function>
          has a boolean flag which indicates whether to do an
          invalidating redraw or a fast scroll. This change breaks API
          and maybe also ABI.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          GtkFitMode was removed along
          with <function>gtk_image_view_set_fit_mode()</function>
          and <function>gtk_image_view_get_fit_mode()</function>.
          Since there were only two items in the enum (fit or not
          fit), it was much cleaner to just pass a gboolean. The
          accessor functions has also been renamed
          to <function>gtk_image_view_set_fitting()</function>
          and <function>gtk_image_view_get_fit_mode()</function> to
          reflect this new and simpler interface. This change also
          breaks API and perhaps even ABI.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            The <classname>GtkImageView</classname> widget has
            undergone major internal reconstruction work. I wanted to
            support making rectangular selections on the view
            area. Selections are useful for many reasons -- selecting,
            cutting, cropping etc. I want to support exactly the kind
            of selection tool that gThumb's image crop dialog has.
          </para>
          <para>
            To implement this feature GtkImageView has been made
            extensible via aggregation. It now uses an interface
            called <interfacename>GtkIImageTool</interfacename> which
            encapsulats certain behaviour. This means that it will be
            possible to extend GtkImageView with other tools too, such
            as drawing tools.
          </para>
          <para>
            The feature isn't completed yet, but I'm checking it in
            anyway to avoid having to check in a super-large changeset
            at an even later date. See <ulink url =
            "http://bjourne.blogspot.com/2007/05/tools-for-gtkimageview.html">this
            blog post</ulink> for even more details.
          </para>
          <para>
            There is currently two tools implemented,
            <classname>GtkImageToolDragger</classname> and
            <classname>GtkImageToolSelector</classname>. See their
            respective manual pages.
          </para>  
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          The
          function <function>gtk_image_view_set_offset_invalidating()</function>
          was added. The function has the same purpose as
          <function>gtk_image_view_set_offset()</function>, but queues
          the redraw by invalidating the whole widget instead of
          immediately repainting. The effect is that superfluous
          redraws can sometimes be avoided at the expense of more cpu
          usage.

          and <function>gtk_image_view_set_transp()</function> was
          added. These additions enable users to define how
          GtkImageView should render transparent parts of images with
          an alpha
          channel. See <filename>./tests/interactive.c</filename> for
          an example.

            <function>gtk_image_view_set_pixbuf()</function> was
            changed to accept three parameters. The third parameter is
            a <type>gboolean</type> that defines whether to reset fit
            mode or not. It should almost always be TRUE.

            This change replaces the old (and

            function.
